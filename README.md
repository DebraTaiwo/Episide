# Episide
A skin project
This project enables users to consult with dermatologists from the comfort of their homes.
The project is developed in a way that allows users to interact freely with a specialist.
The first two screens are splash screens, while the other skins enable users to interact by clicking on buttons to move to the next screen.
The users can login using their emails and passwords. 
In the question/answer section, users are allowed to choose multiple options. Once an option has been chosen, the button color turns gray.
